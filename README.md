#Carboot

Carboot is an item trading system that allows users to exchange items in a one-to-one manner.

Users can instigate a trade request for any item, and review all incoming trade requests. Trades can be rejected at any time, or users can select an item they would like to swap with. Once both parties agree to swap thier items, then they can see the others address to send the item.

Carboot was envisioned and built over a few days as part of a project in the General Assembly curriculum.

## The build
Carboot was built with the following frameworks and technologies:

* [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)
* [Paperclip](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip)
* [Foundation 5](http://foundation.zurb.com/)
* [Atom text editor](https://atom.io/)

## Example User Story
Bob uploads several items that he does not need anymore, he places a suggested value on each item.He then looks though items on the site to see something he wants, he spots a cool book that he likes and request a trade on it.

The owner of that book, Jane, will get a notification saying that Bob would like to trade something for the book. Jane can then look through Bobs items to
see if she wants anything he has.

If Jane does not want an Item Bob has, she can reject the trade.

If Jane does see an item of equal value she wants, she can respond with a trade request for that item.

Bob can then review the two items to trade and accept or reject the trade. If Bob accepts, then each user will receive the others address, and send the items.
